/*
* In the context of this program, these arrays (`metricnames`, `routeflags`, `ifnetflags`, and `addrnames`) are predefined strings that contain names or labels representing certain attributes or flags. These arrays are used as input values for the `s` parameter of the `bprintf` function.

When the `bprintf` function is called with one of these arrays as the `s` parameter, it will iterate through the characters in the array and selectively print characters based on the value of the `b` parameter.

For example, let's say you want to print only the characters from the `metricnames` that correspond to bits 2, 3, and 5 set in the `b` parameter. You would call the `bprintf` function like this:

```c
bprintf(fp, 0b00110100, metricnames);
```

In this case, the `b` parameter has bits 2, 3, and 5 set to 1. The `bprintf` function will print the corresponding characters ('rttvar', 'rtt', 'sendpipe') from the `metricnames` array to the specified file pointer `fp`.

Similarly, you can use the other arrays (`routeflags`, `ifnetflags`, and `addrnames`) in a similar way to selectively print characters based on the specific bits set in the `b` parameter.
